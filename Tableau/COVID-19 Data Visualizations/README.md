# COVID-19 Death and Vaccination Analysis ðŸ¦ ðŸ’‰ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

## Introduction

This project aims to provide insights on the spread of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations by country/continent and date. It also helps to understand the relationship between total cases and total deaths, total cases and population, and analyze the progress of vaccinations and its effect on population.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from the following sources:
- [COVID-19 Deaths dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- [COVID-19 Vaccinations dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

The data is cleaned and pre-processed to combine the datasets and make it ready for analysis in our other project - https://github.com/muhammad-adil86/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/SQL/COVID-19%20Data%20Exploration.

## Dashboards

The project is divided into Tableau dashboards covering:

- Spread of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Location and Date: Analyze the progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries and continents, and create forecasts for future death tolls
- Relationship between Total Cases and Total Deaths: Explore the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as the relationship with population and the variation in mortality rate among different countries and continents
- Spread of COVID-19 Cases and Vaccinations by Location and Date: Understand the spread of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations by different countries and continents over time
- Relationship between Total Cases and Total Vaccinations: Explore the relationship between total cases and total vaccinations, and between total cases and population, along with the vaccination rate across different countries and continents
- Analysis of Vaccinations Progress: Analyzes the progress of vaccinations and its effect on population by different countries and continents

## Conclusion

Overall, this project offers a comprehensive view of the ongoing pandemic, providing a valuable tool for tracking the spread of COVID-19 and the progress of vaccination efforts. With data visualization and forecasting analysis using Tableau, it will give a better understanding of the current and future situation of COVID-19.
