# Data Analytics Portfolio [![portfolio](https://img.shields.io/badge/my_portfolio-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=white)](https://muhammad-adil86.github.io/muhammad-adil.github.io/)[![linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-0A66C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammadadil86/)

This repository contains my personal projects related to SQL (self-joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, Views), Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib , seaborn), Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Cognos Analytics, and other data analytics tools.

The purpose of this repository is mainly to showcase my skills and experience as a data analyst, and to share my projects with others who may be interested in learning or using these tools. These projects cover a variety of topics including data cleaning, standardization, and visualization in order to uncover patterns/insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

Some of the projects in this repository use real-world datasets, while others are based on simulated data. I believe that it is essential for data analysts to work with real data, and I have chosen datasets that are publicly available and representative of the types of data that analysts typically encounter.

Feel free to use this repository as a resource, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammadadil86/).

Note: the data set that I have used in this repository are publicly available, but please be respectful of the data and the original creators of it.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
