# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

This project showcases my skills in data exploration and cleaning using SQL. It utilized variety of SQL commands such as joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types to analyze and gain insights from the COVID-19 dataset. 

## Objectives

- To understand the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths by location and date
- To explore the relationship between total cases and total deaths, and between total cases and population
- To compare mortality rate across different countries and continents
- To analyze the progress of vaccinations and its effect on population

## Data Sources
- [COVID-19 Deaths dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- [COVID-19 Vaccinations dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

## Data Exploration

- Utilized SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, and CONVERT commands to standardize date format and populate missing data in the NashvilleHousing dataset.
- Used SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, and LEN functions to break down address data into individual columns.
- Used joins and CTEs to combine COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets and to analyze the relationships between population, cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Utilized MAX and SUM aggregate functions, and ROUND and CONVERT conversion functions to compare mortality rates across different locations and continents.

## Conclusion

The data exploration carried out in this project provides insights on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected different countries and continents and how the rate of vaccinations has affected the population. It allows us to see the relationships between different variables and gain a better understanding of the impact of the pandemic.
