# Bike Consumer Segmentation and Sales Analysis 🚴‍♀️💰📈

## Introduction
This project uses Excel to create a dashboard that illustrates bike sales based on income level, age, and daily commute distance. The dashboard also includes a slicer to filter the results by marital status, region, and education. The goal of this project is to provide insights into the factors that influence bike sales and help bike manufacturers and retailers better understand their target market.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

The data for this project was obtained from [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx). The survey included questions about income level, age, daily commute distance, marital status, region, and education. The data was cleaned to remove any missing or invalid values and to standardize the format of the variables.

## Dashboard

The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It includes a variety of charts and tables to visualize the data, including a column chart to show the distribution of bike sales by income level for male & female biker, a line chart to show the distribution of bike sales by age, as well as the distribution of bike sales by daily commute distance. The dashboard also includes a slicer to allow users to filter the data by marital status, region, and education.

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a clear and comprehensive view of bike sales based on income level, age, and daily commute distance. It also allows users to understand the influence of marital status, region, and education on bike sales. The insights gained from this dashboard can be used by bike manufacturers and retailers to better understand their target market and make informed decisions about their product offerings and marketing strategies.
